## ABOUT THE PROJECT

Building a website with Drupal10 including:
- Component-driven architecture:
    + Each section will be a component containing list of fields for inputting data (text & image)
    + Components can be re-ordered on a edition page
- Multilingual
    + English (default): /
    + Simplified Chinese: /zh-hans
- Metatag supported
- The website has a simple Home page and the demo AboutUs page and Page-not-found page.
- URLs to AboutUs page:
    + EN: /about-us
    + ZH-HANS: /zh-hans/about-us
- CSS+JS:
    + The website foces on building content with Drupal10, reusing existing CSS from https://it-consultis.com/about-us/
    + Due to the different approach, the JS from https://it-consultis.com/about-us/ is not compatible, therefore no JS added to the page.
